Behavioral Patterns: Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction and communication between objects, 
defining how objects behave and collaborate to achieve specific tasks or responsibilities. 
These patterns help to manage the algorithms and responsibilities of objects within a system. 
Examples of behavioral patterns include Observer, Strategy, Command, and Iterator.

Structural Design Patterns: Structural design patterns focus on the composition and structure of objects, 
defining how classes and objects are connected or organized to form larger structures. 
These patterns deal with relationships between objects and aim to provide flexible ways to create and manage object structures. 
Examples of structural design patterns include Adapter, Decorator, Composite, and Proxy.

Creational design patterns focus on the process of object creation, providing mechanisms for creating objects in a flexible and decoupled manner. 
These patterns aim to abstract the instantiation process and hide the complexities of object creation.
Examples of Creational design patterns include Singleton Pattern, Builder Pattern, Factory Method Pattern
